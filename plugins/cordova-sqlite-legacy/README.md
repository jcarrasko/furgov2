## BREAKING CHANGE: Database location is now mandatory

The `location` or `iosDatabaseLocation` *must* be specified in the `openDatabase` and `deleteDatabase` calls, as documented below.

### IMPORTANT: iCloud backup of SQLite database is NOT allowed

As documented in the "**A User’s iCloud Storage Is Limited**" section of [iCloudFundamentals in Mac Developer Library iCloud Design Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/General/Conceptual/iCloudDesignGuide/Chapters/iCloudFundametals.html) (near the beginning):

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>DO</b> store the following in iCloud:
  <ul>
   <li>[<i>other items omitted</i>]</li>
   <li>Change log files for a SQLite database (a SQLite database’s store file must never be stored in iCloud)</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>DO NOT</b> store the following in iCloud:
  <ul>
   <li>[<i>items omitted</i>]</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
- <cite><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/General/Conceptual/iCloudDesignGuide/Chapters/iCloudFundametals.html">iCloudFundamentals in Mac Developer Library iCloud Design Guide</a>
</blockquote>

### How to disable iCloud backup

Use the `location` or `iosDatabaseLocation` option in `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()` to store the database in a subdirectory that is *NOT* backed up to iCloud, as described in the section below.

**NOTE:** Changing `BackupWebStorage` in `config.xml` has no effect on a database created by this plugin. `BackupWebStorage` applies only to local storage and/or Web SQL storage created in the WebView (*not* using this plugin).

Such part-time assignments would help [@brodybits](https://github.com/brodybits) keep this project alive.

## Status

- iOS database location is now mandatory, as documented below.
- This version supports the use of two (2) possible Android sqlite database implementations:
  - default: lightweight [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector)
  - optional: built-in Android database classes (usage described below)
- Windows 8.1(+)/Windows Phone 8.1(+) version is in an alpha state with sqlite `3.8.10.2` embedded:
  - Native build for Windows 10 is still missing
  - Issue with UNICODE `\u0000` character (same as `\0`)
  - No background processing (for future consideration)
  - You *may* encounter issues with Cordova CLI due to [CB-8866](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-8866). *Old workaround:* you can install using [litehelpers / cordova-windows-nufix](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-windows-nufix) and `plugman` as described below.
  - In addition, problems with the Windows version have been reported in case of a Cordova project using a Visual Studio template/extension instead of Cordova/PhoneGap CLI or `plugman`
  - Not tested with a Windows 10 (or Windows Phone 10) target; Windows 10 build is not expected to work with Windows Phone
- Status for the other target platforms:
  - Android: now using [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector) (with sqlite `3.8.10.2` embedded in [Android-sqlite-native-driver](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-native-driver)), with support for FTS3/FTS4 and R-Tree
  - iOS: sqlite `3.8.10.2` embedded
  - WP7: possible to build from C#, as specified by `plugin.xml` - **NOT TESTED**
  - WP8: performance/stability issues have been reported with the CSharp-SQLite library. Windows ("Universal") platform is recommended for the future. FTS3/FTS4/R-Tree are NOT supported for WP(7/8).
- FTS3, FTS4, and R-Tree are *not* supported for WP(7/8)
- Android is supported back to SDK 10 (a.k.a. Gingerbread, Android 2.3.3); support for older versions is available upon request.
- API to open the database may be changed somewhat to be more streamlined. Transaction and single-statement query API will NOT be changed.
- In case of memory issues please use smaller transactions or use the version (with a different licensing scheme) at: [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-enterprise-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-enterprise-free) or [litehelpers / cordova-sqlite-workers-evfree](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-sqlite-workers-evfree)

- [Tangorin](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tangorin.app) (Android) Japanese Dictionary at [tangorin.com](http://tangorin.com/)

## Known issues

- iOS version does not support certain rapidly repeated open-and-close or open-and-delete test scenarios due to how the implementation handles background processing
- As described below, auto-vacuum is NOT enabled by default.
- INSERT statement that affects multiple rows (due to SELECT cause or using TRIGGER(s), for example) does not report proper rowsAffected on Android in case the built-in Android database used (using the `androidDatabaseImplementation` option in `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase`)
- Memory issue observed when adding a large number of records due to the JSON implementation which is improved in [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-enterprise-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-enterprise-free) (available with a different licensing scheme)
- A stability issue was reported on the iOS version when in use together with [SockJS](http://sockjs.org/) client such as [pusher-js](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-js) at the same time (see [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#196](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/196)). The workaround is to call sqlite functions and [SockJS](http://sockjs.org/) client functions in separate ticks (using setTimeout with 0 timeout).
- If a sql statement fails for which there is no error handler or the error handler does not return `false` to signal transaction recovery, the plugin fires the remaining sql callbacks before aborting the transaction.
- In case of an error, the error `code` member is bogus on Android, Windows 8.1(+)/Windows Phone 8.1(+), and WP(7/8) (fixed for Android in [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-enterprise-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-enterprise-free)).
- Possible crash on Android when using Unicode emoji characters due to [Android bug 81341](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=81341), which _should_ be fixed in Android 6.x
- Close database bugs described below.
- When a database is opened and deleted without closing, the iOS version is known to leak resources.
- It is NOT possible to open multiple databases with the same name but in different locations (iOS version).
- DROP table does not actually delete it in WP(7/8) version, due to limitations of CSharp-SQLite.
- Problems reported with PhoneGap Build in the past:
  - PhoneGap Build Hydration.
  - Apparently FIXED: ~~PhoneGap Build may fail to build the iOS version unless the name of the app starts with an uppercase and contains no spaces (see [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#243](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/243); [Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin#830](https://github.com/Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin/issues/830); [phonegap/build#431](https://github.com/phonegap/build/issues/431)).~~

## Other limitations

- The db version, display name, and size parameter values are not supported and will be ignored.
- _Absolute and relative subdirectory path(s) are not tested or supported._
- This plugin will not work before the callback for the 'deviceready' event has been fired, as described in **Usage**. (This is consistent with the other Cordova plugins.)
- This version will not work within a web worker (not properly supported by the Cordova framework).
- In-memory database `db=window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: ":memory:"})` is currently not supported.
- The Android version cannot work with more than 100 open db files (due to the threading model used).
- Needs testing: ~~_(Certain)_ UNICODE characters are not working in WP(7/8) version~~
- UNICODE line separator (`\u2028`) and paragraph separator (`\u2029`) are currently not supported and known to be broken in iOS version due to [Cordova bug CB-9435](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-9435). There *may* be a similar issue with other UNICODE characters in the iOS version (needs further investigation). This is fixed in: [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-enterprise-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-enterprise-free) (available with a different licensing scheme)
- Blob type is currently not supported and known to be broken on multiple platforms.
- UNICODE `\u0000` (same as `\0`) character not working in Android (default native database implementation), Windows 8.1(+)/Windows Phone 8.1(+), or WP(7/8)
- Case-insensitive matching and other string manipulations on Unicode characters, which is provided by optional ICU integration in the sqlite source and working with recent versions of Android, is not supported for any target platforms.
- iOS version uses a thread pool but with only one thread working at a time due to "synchronized" database access
- Large query result can be slow, also due to JSON implementation
- ATTACH to another database file is not supported (due to path specifications, which work differently depending on the target platform)
- User-defined savepoints are not supported and not expected to be compatible with the transaction locking mechanism used by this plugin. In addition, the use of BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK statements is not supported.
- Problems have been reported when using this plugin with Crosswalk (for Android). It may help to install Crosswalk as a plugin instead of using Crosswalk to create the project.
- Does not work with [axemclion / react-native-cordova-plugin](https://github.com/axemclion/react-native-cordova-plugin) since the `window.sqlitePlugin` object exported (ES5 feature). It is recommended to use [andpor / react-native-sqlite-storage](https://github.com/andpor/react-native-sqlite-storage) for SQLite database access with React Native Android/iOS instead.

## Further testing needed

- _Integration with PhoneGap developer app_
- Multi-page apps
- Use within [InAppBrowser](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/cordova_inappbrowser_inappbrowser.md.html)
- Use within an iframe (see [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#368 (comment)](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/368#issuecomment-154046367))
- SAVEPOINT(s)
- FTS3/FTS4 and R-Tree are not fully tested or supported for WP(7/8)
- R-Tree is not tested with some older releases of Android
- UNICODE characters not fully tested
- Use with TRIGGER(s), JOIN and ORDER BY RANDOM
- Integration with JXCore for Cordova (must be built without sqlite(3) built-in)
- Delete an open database inside a statement or transaction callback.

## Some tips and tricks

- If you run into problems and your code follows the asynchronous HTML5/[Web SQL](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) transaction API, you can try opening your database using `window.openDatabase` and see if you get the same problems.
- In case your database schema may change, it is recommended to keep a table with one row and one column to keep track of your own shema version number. It is possible to add it later. The recommended schema update procedure is described below.

## Common pitfall(s)

- It is possible to make a Windows Phone 8.1 project using either the `windows` platform or the `wp8` platform. The `windows` platform is highly recommended over `wp8` whenever possible. Also, some plugins only support `windows` and some plugins support only `wp8`.
- It is NOT allowed to execute sql statements on a transaction following the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/), as described below.
- The plugin class name starts with "SQL" in capital letters, but in Javascript the `sqlitePlugin` object name starts with "sql" in small letters.
- Attempting to open a database before receiving the 'deviceready' event callback.
- Inserting STRING into ID field
- Auto-vacuum is NOT enabled by default. It is recommended to periodically VACUUM the database.

## Weird pitfall(s)

- intent whitelist: blocked intent such as external URL intent *may* cause this and perhaps certain Cordova plugin(s) to misbehave (see [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#396](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/396))

## Angular/ngCordova/Ionic-related pitfalls

- Angular/ngCordova/Ionic controller/factory/service callbacks may be triggered before the 'deviceready' event is fired
- As discussed in [#355](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/355), it may be necessary to install ionic-plugin-keyboard

## Major TODOs

- Integrate with IndexedDBShim and some other libraries such as Sequelize, Squel.js, WebSqlSync, Persistence.js, Knex, etc.

# Usage

## Echo test

To verify that both the Javascript and native part of this plugin are installed in your application:

```js
window.sqlitePlugin.echoTest(successCallback, errorCallback);
```

**IMPORTANT:** Please wait for the 'deviceready' event (see below for an example).

## General

The idea is to emulate the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) as closely as possible. The only major change is to use `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()` (or `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()`) *with parameters as documented below* instead of `window.openDatabase()`. If you see any other major change please report it, it is probably a bug.

**NOTE:** If a sqlite statement in a transaction fails with an error, the error handler *must* return `false` in order to recover the transaction. This is correct according to the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) standard. This is different from the WebKit implementation of Web SQL in Android and iOS which recovers the transaction if a sql error hander returns a non-`true` value.

## Opening a database

~~There are two options~~ to open a database access object:
- **Recommended:** `var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', iosDatabaseLocation: 'default'}, successcb, errorcb);`
- No longer supported: ~~**Classical:** `var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase("myDatabase.db", "1.0", "Demo", -1);`~~

The `iosDatabaseLocation` option is used to select the database subdirectory location (iOS *only*) with the following choices:
- `default`: `Library/LocalDatabase` subdirectory - *NOT* visible to iTunes and *NOT* backed up by iCloud (will be the default in the future)
- `Library`: `Library` subdirectory - backed up by iCloud, *NOT* visible to iTunes
- `Documents`: `Documents` subdirectory - visible to iTunes and backed up by iCloud

**WARNING:** The new "default" iosDatabaseLocation value is *NOT* the same as the old default location and would break an upgrade for an app using the old default.

*ALTERNATIVE (deprecated):*
- `var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db", location: 1}, successcb, errorcb);`

The `location` option is used to select the database subdirectory location (iOS *only*) with the following choices:
- `0` ~~(default)~~: `Documents` - visible to iTunes and backed up by iCloud
- `1`: `Library` - backed up by iCloud, *NOT* visible to iTunes
- `2`: `Library/LocalDatabase` - *NOT* visible to iTunes and *NOT* backed up by iCloud

**IMPORTANT:** Please wait for the 'deviceready' event, as in the following example:

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener('deviceready', onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', iosDatabaseLocation: 'default'});
  // ...
}
```

The successcb and errorcb callback parameters are optional but can be extremely helpful in case anything goes wrong. For example:

```js
window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', iosDatabaseLocation: 'default'}, function(db) {
  db.transaction(function(tx) {
    // ...
  }, function(err) {
    console.log('Open database ERROR: ' + JSON.stringify(err));
  });
});
```

If any sql statements or transactions are attempted on a database object before the openDatabase result is known, they will be queued and will be aborted in case the database cannot be opened.

**OTHER NOTES:**
- The database file name should include the extension, if desired.
- It is possible to open multiple database access objects for the same database.
- The database access object can be closed as described below.

**TIP:**

To overwrite `window.openDatabase`:

```Javascript
window.openDatabase = function(dbname, ignored1, ignored2, ignored3) {
  return window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: dbname, iosDatabaseLocation: 'default'});
};
```

### Android sqlite implementation

By default, this plugin uses [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector), which is lightweight and should be more efficient than the built-in Android database classes. To use the built-in Android database classes instead:

```js
var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db", androidDatabaseImplementation: 2});
```

### Workaround for Android db locking issue

[litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#193](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/193) was reported (as observed by several app developers) that on some newer versions of the Android database classes, if the app is stopped or aborted without closing the database then:
- (sometimes) there is an unexpected database lock
- the data that was inserted is lost.

This issue is suspected to be caused by [this Android sqlite commit](https://github.com/android/platform_external_sqlite/commit/d4f30d0d1544f8967ee5763c4a1680cb0553039f), which references and includes the sqlite commit at: http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/6c4c2b7dba

There is an optional workaround that simply closes and reopens the database file at the end of every transaction that is committed. The workaround is enabled by opening the database with options as follows:

```js
var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', androidLockWorkaround: 1});
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This workaround is *only* applied when using `db.transaction()`, *not* applied when running `executeSql()` on the database object.

## SQL transactions

The following types of SQL transactions are supported by this version:
- Single-statement transactions
- SQL batch query transactions
- Standard asynchronous transactions

### Single-statement transactions

Sample:

```Javascript
db.executeSql("SELECT LENGTH('tenletters') AS stringlength", [], function (res) {
  console.log('got stringlength: ' + res.rows.item(0).stringlength);
}, function(error) {
  console.log('SELECT error: ' + error.message);
});
```

### SQL batch query transactions

Sample:

```Javascript
db.sqlBatch([
  'DROP TABLE IF EXISTS MyTable',
  'CREATE TABLE MyTable (SampleColumn)',
  [ 'INSERT INTO MyTable VALUES (?)', ['test-value'] ],
], function() {
  db.executeSql('SELECT * FROM MyTable', [], function (res) {
    console.log('Sample column value: ' + res.rows.item(0).SampleColumn);
  });
}, function(error) {
  console.log('Populate table error: ' + error.message);
});
```

In case of an error, all changes in a sql batch are automatically discarded using ROLLBACK.

### Standard asynchronous transactions

Standard asynchronous transactions follow the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) which is very well documented and uses BEGIN and COMMIT or ROLLBACK to keep the transactions failure-safe. Here is a very simple example from the test suite:

```Javascript
db.transaction(function(tx) {
  tx.executeSql("SELECT UPPER('Some US-ASCII text') AS uppertext", [], function(tx, res) {
    console.log("res.rows.item(0).uppertext: " + res.rows.item(0).uppertext);
  }, function(error) {
    console.log('SELECT error: ' + error.message);
  });
}, function(error) {
  console.log('transaction error: ' + error.message);
}, function() {
  console.log('transaction ok');
});
```

In case of a read-only transaction, it is possible to use `readTransaction` which will not use BEGIN, COMMIT, or ROLLBACK:

```Javascript
db.readTransaction(function(tx) {
  tx.executeSql("SELECT UPPER('Some US-ASCII text') AS uppertext", [], function(tx, res) {
    console.log("res.rows.item(0).uppertext: " + res.rows.item(0).uppertext);
  }, function(error) {
    console.log('SELECT error: ' + error.message);
  });
}, function(error) {
  console.log('transaction error: ' + error.message);
}, function() {
  console.log('transaction ok');
});
```

**WARNING:** It is NOT allowed to execute sql statements on a transaction after it has finished. Here is an example from my [Populating Cordova SQLite storage with the JQuery API post](http://www.brodybits.com/cordova/sqlite/api/jquery/2015/10/26/populating-cordova-sqlite-storage-with-the-jquery-api.html):

```Javascript

  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "test.db"});
  db.executeSql("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tt");
  db.executeSql("CREATE TABLE tt (data)");

  db.transaction(function(tx) {
    $.ajax({
      url: 'https://api.github.com/users/litehelpers/repos',
      dataType: 'json',
      success: function(res) {
        console.log('Got AJAX response: ' + JSON.stringify(res));
        $.each(res, function(i, item) {
          console.log('REPO NAME: ' + item.name);
          tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO tt values (?)", JSON.stringify(item.name));
        });
      }
    });
  }, function(e) {
    console.log('Transaction error: ' + e.message);
  }, function() {
    // Check results:
    db.executeSql('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tt', [], function(res) {
      console.log('Check SELECT result: ' + JSON.stringify(res.rows.item(0)));
    });
  });
```

You can find more details and a step-by-step description how to do this right in the [Populating Cordova SQLite storage with the JQuery API post](http://www.brodybits.com/cordova/sqlite/api/jquery/2015/10/26/populating-cordova-sqlite-storage-with-the-jquery-api.html):

**BUG:** If a row item object is retrieved twice, they should be safe from each other.
But this is not the case. This sample program demonstrates the bug:

```Javascript
var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db"});

var res1 = null,
    res2 = null;

db.transaction(function(tx) {
  tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table (id integer primary key, data text, data_num integer)');
  tx.executeSql('INSERT INTO test_table (data, data_num) VALUES (?,?)', ['test', 101], function(tx, res) {

  tx.executeSql('SELECT * FROM test_table;', [], function(tx, res) {

    res1 = res.rows.item(0);
    res2 = res.rows.item(0);

    res1.data = 'another';

    // immediate check:
    console.log('res1.data = ' + res1.data);
    // output: res2.data = 'another'
    console.log('res2.data = ' + res2.data);
  });

}, function(e) {
  console.log('Transaction error: ' + e.message);
}, function() {
  // check stored info:
  console.log('res1.data: ' + res1.data);
  // output: res2.data = 'another';
  console.log('res2.data: ' + res2.data);
});
```

## Background processing

The threading model depends on which version is used:
- For Android and WP(7/8), one background thread per db;
- for iOS, background processing using a very limited thread pool (only one thread working at a time);
- for Windows 8.1(+)/Windows Phone 8.1(+), no background processing (for future consideration).

## Sample with PRAGMA feature

Creates a table, adds a single entry, then queries the count to check if the item was inserted as expected. Note that a new transaction is created in the middle of the first callback.

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener('deviceready', onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db"});

  db.transaction(function(tx) {
    tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_table');
    tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table (id integer primary key, data text, data_num integer)');

    // demonstrate PRAGMA:
    db.executeSql("pragma table_info (test_table);", [], function(res) {
      console.log("PRAGMA res: " + JSON.stringify(res));
    });

    tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO test_table (data, data_num) VALUES (?,?)", ["test", 100], function(tx, res) {
      console.log("insertId: " + res.insertId + " -- probably 1");
      console.log("rowsAffected: " + res.rowsAffected + " -- should be 1");

      db.transaction(function(tx) {
        tx.executeSql("select count(id) as cnt from test_table;", [], function(tx, res) {
          console.log("res.rows.length: " + res.rows.length + " -- should be 1");
          console.log("res.rows.item(0).cnt: " + res.rows.item(0).cnt + " -- should be 1");
        });
      });

    }, function(e) {
      console.log("ERROR: " + e.message);
    });
  });
}
```

**NOTE:** PRAGMA statements must be executed in `executeSql()` on the database object (i.e. `db.executeSql()`) and NOT within a transaction.

## Sample with transaction-level nesting

In this case, the same transaction in the first executeSql() callback is being reused to run executeSql() again.

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener('deviceready', onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase("Database", "1.0", "Demo", -1);

  db.transaction(function(tx) {
    tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_table');
    tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table (id integer primary key, data text, data_num integer)');

    tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO test_table (data, data_num) VALUES (?,?)", ["test", 100], function(tx, res) {
      console.log("insertId: " + res.insertId + " -- probably 1");
      console.log("rowsAffected: " + res.rowsAffected + " -- should be 1");

      tx.executeSql("select count(id) as cnt from test_table;", [], function(tx, res) {
        console.log("res.rows.length: " + res.rows.length + " -- should be 1");
        console.log("res.rows.item(0).cnt: " + res.rows.item(0).cnt + " -- should be 1");
      });

    }, function(e) {
      console.log("ERROR: " + e.message);
    });
  });
}
```

This case will also works with Safari (WebKit), assuming you replace `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase` with `window.openDatabase`.

## Close a database object

```js
db.close(successcb, errorcb);
```

It is OK to close the database within a transaction callback but *NOT* within a statement callback. The following example is OK:

```Javascript
db.transaction(function(tx) {
  tx.executeSql("SELECT LENGTH('tenletters') AS stringlength", [], function(tx, res) {
    console.log('got stringlength: ' + res.rows.item(0).stringlength);
  });
}, function(error) {
  // OK to close here:
  console.log('transaction error: ' + error.message);
  db.close();
}, function() {
  // OK to close here:
  console.log('transaction ok');
  db.close(function() {
    console.log('database is closed ok');
  });
});
```

The following example is NOT OK:

```Javascript
// BROKEN:
db.transaction(function(tx) {
  tx.executeSql("SELECT LENGTH('tenletters') AS stringlength", [], function(tx, res) {
    console.log('got stringlength: ' + res.rows.item(0).stringlength);
    // BROKEN - this will trigger the error callback:
    db.close(function() {
      console.log('database is closed ok');
    }, function(error) {
      console.log('ERROR closing database');
    });
  });
});
```

**BUG 1:** It is currently NOT possible to close a database in a `db.executeSql` callback. For example:

```Javascript
// BROKEN DUE TO BUG:
db.executeSql("SELECT LENGTH('tenletters') AS stringlength", [], function (res) {
  var stringlength = res.rows.item(0).stringlength;
  console.log('got stringlength: ' + res.rows.item(0).stringlength);

  // BROKEN - this will trigger the error callback DUE TO BUG:
  db.close(function() {
    console.log('database is closed ok');
  }, function(error) {
    console.log('ERROR closing database');
  });
});
```

**BUG 2:** If multiple database access objects are opened for the same database and one database access object is closed, the database is no longer available for the other database access objects. Possible workarounds:
- It is still possible to open one or more new database access objects on a database that has been closed.
- It *should* be OK not to explicitly close a database handle since database transactions are [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) compliant and the app's memory resources are cleaned up by the system upon termination.

## Delete a database

```js
window.sqlitePlugin.deleteDatabase({name: 'my.db', iosDatabaseLocation: 'default'}, successcb, errorcb);
```

with `iosDatabaseLocation` or `location` *required* as described above for `openDatabase` (iOS *only*)

# Schema versions

The transactional nature of the API makes it relatively straightforward to manage a database schema that may be upgraded over time (adding new columns or new tables, for example). Here is the recommended procedure to follow upon app startup:
- Check your database schema version number (you can use `db.executeSql` since it should be a very simple query)
- If your database needs to be upgraded, do the following *within a single transaction* to be failure-safe:
  - Create your database schema version table (single row single column) if it does not exist (you can check the `sqlite_master` table as described at: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1601151/how-do-i-check-in-sqlite-whether-a-table-exists)
  - Add any missing columns and tables, and apply any other changes necessary

**IMPORTANT:** Since we cannot be certain when the users will actually update their apps, old schema versions will have to be supported for a very long time.

## Use with Ionic/ngCordova/Angular

It is recommended to follow the tutorial at: https://blog.nraboy.com/2014/11/use-sqlite-instead-local-storage-ionic-framework/

Documentation at: http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/sqlite/

# Installing

## Windows target platform

**IMPORTANT:** There are issues supporing certain Windows target platforms due to [CB-8866](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-8866):
- When using Visual Studio, the default target ("Mixed Platforms") will not work
- Problems have been with the Windows "Universal" version case of a Cordova project using a Visual Studio template/extension instead of Cordova/PhoneGap CLI or `plugman`

*Old workaround:* As an alternative, which will support the ("Mixed Platforms") target, you can use `plugman` instead with [litehelpers / cordova-windows-nufix](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-windows-nufix), as described here.

### Old workaround - Using plugman to support "Mixed Platforms"

- make sure you have the latest version of `plugman` installed: `npm install -g plugman`
- Download the [cordova-windows-nufix 3.9.0-nufixpre-01 zipball](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-windows-nufix/archive/3.9.0-nufixpre-01.zip) (or you can clone [litehelpers / cordova-windows-nufix](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-windows-nufix) instead)
- Create your Windows "Universal" (8.1) project using [litehelpers / cordova-windows-nufix](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-windows-nufix):
  - `path.to.cordova-windows-nufix/bin/create.bat your_app_path your.app.id YourAppName`
- `cd your_app_path` and install plugin using `plugman`:
  - `plugman install --platform windows --project . --plugin https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-legacy`
- Put your sql program in your project `www` (don't forget to reference it from `www\index.html` and wait for `deviceready` event)

Then your project in `CordovaApp.sln` should work with "Mixed Platforms" on both Windows 8.1(+) and Windows Phone 8.1(+).

## Easy install with Cordova CLI tool

    npm install -g cordova # if you don't have cordova
    cordova create MyProjectFolder com.my.project MyProject && cd MyProjectFolder # if you are just starting
    cordova plugin add https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage

You can find more details at [this writeup](http://iphonedevlog.wordpress.com/2014/04/07/installing-chris-brodys-sqlite-database-with-cordova-cli-android/).

**WARNING:** for Windows 8.1(+)/Windows Phone 8.1(+) target platform please read the section above.

**IMPORTANT:** sometimes you have to update the version for a platform before you can build, like: `cordova prepare ios`

**NOTE:** If you cannot build for a platform after `cordova prepare`, you may have to remove the platform and add it again, such as:

    cordova platform rm ios
    cordova platform add ios

## Easy install with plugman tool

```shell
plugman install --platform MYPLATFORM --project path.to.my.project.folder --plugin https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-legacy
```

where MYPLATFORM is `android`, `ios`, `windows`, or `wp8`.

A posting how to get started developing on Windows host without the Cordova CLI tool (for Android target only) is available [here](http://brodybits.blogspot.com/2015/03/trying-cordova-for-android-on-windows-without-cordova-cli.html).

## Installation sources

- `src`: platform-specific source code:
   - `external` - placeholder for external dependencies - *not required in this version*
   - `android` - Java plugin code for Android (along with [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector) and [Android-sqlite-native-driver](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-native-driver) library jars)
   - `ios` - Objective-C plugin code for iOS
   - `windows` - Javascript proxy code and SQLite3-WinRT project for Windows 8.1(+)/Windows Phone (8.1)
   - `wp` - C-sharp code for WP(7/8)
- `spec`: test suite using Jasmine (2.2.0)

- `Lawnchair-adapter`: Lawnchair adaptor, based on the version from the Lawnchair repository, with the basic Lawnchair test suite in `test-www` subdirectory

## Installation test

### Easy installation test

Use `window.sqlitePlugin.echoTest` as described above (please wait for the `deviceready` event).

### Quick installation test

Assuming your app has a recent template as used by the Cordova create script, add the following code to the `onDeviceReady` function, after `app.receivedEvent('deviceready');`:

```Javascript
  window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({ name: 'hello-world.db' }, function (db) {
    db.executeSql("select length('tenletters') as stringlength", [], function (res) {
      var stringlength = res.rows.item(0).stringlength;
      console.log('got stringlength: ' + stringlength);
      document.getElementById('deviceready').querySelector('.received').innerHTML = 'stringlength: ' + stringlength;
   });
  });
```

## Policy

Free support is provided on a best-effort basis and is only available in public forums. Please follow the steps below to be sure you have done your best before requesting help.

Commercial support is available by contacting: <info@litehelpers.net>

## Before asking for help

First steps:
- Verify that you have followed the steps in [brodybits / Cordova-quick-start-checklist](https://github.com/brodybits/Cordova-quick-start-checklist)
- Try the new echo test as described above
- Check the troubleshooting steps and pitfalls in [brodybits / Cordova-troubleshooting-guide](https://github.com/brodybits/Cordova-troubleshooting-guide)

and check the following:
- You are using the latest version of the Plugin Javascript & platform-specific Java or Objective-C source from this repository.
- You have installed the Javascript & platform-specific Java or Objective-C correctly.
- You have included the correct version of the cordova Javascript and SQLitePlugin.js and got the path right.
- You have registered the plugin properly in `config.xml`.

If you still cannot get something to work:
- create a fresh, clean Cordova project;
- add this plugin according to the instructions above;
- double-check that you follwed the steps in [brodybits / Cordova-quick-start-checklist](https://github.com/brodybits/Cordova-quick-start-checklist);
- try a simple test program;
- double-check the troubleshooting steps and pitfalls in [brodybits / Cordova-troubleshooting-guide](https://github.com/brodybits/Cordova-troubleshooting-guide)

If you continue to see the issue in the fresh, clean Cordova project:
- Make the simplest test program you can to demonstrate the issue, including the following characteristics:
  - it completely self-contained, i.e. it is using no extra libraries beyond cordova & SQLitePlugin.js;
  - if the issue is with *adding* data to a table, that the test program includes the statements you used to open the database and create the table;
  - if the issue is with *retrieving* data from a table, that the test program includes the statements you used to open the database, create the table, and enter the data you are trying to retrieve.

## What will be supported for free

Please make a small, self-contained test program that can demonstrate your problem and post it. Please do not use any other plugins or frameworks than are absolutely necessary to demonstrate your problem.

In case of a problem with a pre-populated database, please post your entire project.

## Support for issues with Angular/"ngCordova"/Ionic

Free support for issues with Angular/"ngCordova"/Ionic will only be provided if you can demonstrate that you can do the same thing without such a framework.
- Make a fresh, clean ngCordova or Ionic project with a test program that demonstrates the issue and post it. Please do not use any other plugins or frameworks unless absolutely necessary to demonstrate your issue.
- Make another project without any form of Angular including ngCordova or Ionic, with the same test program to show that it will work outside Angular/"ngCordova"/Ionic.

## What information is needed for help

Please include the following:
- Which platform(s) Android/iOS/WP8/Windows 8.1/Windows Phone 8.1
- Clear description of the issue
- A small, complete, self-contained program that demonstrates the problem, preferably as a Github project. ZIP/TGZ/BZ2 archive available from a public link is OK. No RAR or other such formats please!
- A Cordova project is highly preferred. Intel, MS IDE, or similar project formats should be avoided.

## Please do NOT use any of these formats

- screen casts or videos
- RAR or similar archive formats
- Intel, MS IDE, or similar project formats unless absolutely necessary

## Professional support

Professional support is available, please contact: <info@litehelpers.net>

# Unit tests

Unit testing is done in `spec`.

## running tests from shell

To run the tests from \*nix shell, simply do either:

    ./bin/test.sh ios

or for Android:

    ./bin/test.sh android

To run from a windows powershell (here is a sample for android target):

    .\bin\test.ps1 android

# Adapters

## Lawnchair Adapter

### Common adapter

Please look at the `Lawnchair-adapter` tree that contains a common adapter, which should also work with the Android version, along with a test-www directory.

### Included files

Include the following Javascript files in your HTML:

- `cordova.js` (don't forget!)
- `lawnchair.js` (you provide)
- `SQLitePlugin.js` (in case of Cordova pre-3.0)
- `Lawnchair-sqlitePlugin.js` (must come after `SQLitePlugin.js` in case of Cordova pre-3.0)

### Sample

The `name` option determines the sqlite database filename, *with no extension automatically added*. Optionally, you can change the db filename using the `db` option.

In this example, you would be using/creating a database with filename `kvstore`:

```Javascript
kvstore = new Lawnchair({name: "kvstore"}, function() {
  // do stuff
);
```

Using the `db` option you can specify the filename with the desired extension and be able to create multiple stores in the same database file. (There will be one table per store.)

```Javascript
recipes = new Lawnchair({db: "cookbook", name: "recipes", ...}, myCallback());
ingredients = new Lawnchair({db: "cookbook", name: "ingredients", ...}, myCallback());
```

**KNOWN ISSUE:** the new db options are *not* supported by the Lawnchair adapter. The workaround is to first open the database file using `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()`.

## PouchDB

The adapter is now part of [PouchDB](http://pouchdb.com/) thanks to [@nolanlawson](https://github.com/nolanlawson), see [PouchDB FAQ](http://pouchdb.com/faq.html).

**NOTE:** The PouchDB adapter has not been tested with the new [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector). You may need to include `androidDatabaseImplementation: 2` in the `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()` options as described above.

# Contributing

## Community

- Testimonials of apps that are using this plugin would be especially helpful.
- Reporting issues can help improve the quality of this plugin.

## Code

**WARNING:** Please do NOT propose changes from your default branch. In general, contributions are rebased using `git rebase` or `git cherry-pick` and not merged.

- Patches with bug fixes are helpful, especially when submitted with test code.
- Other enhancements welcome for consideration, when submitted with test code and are working for all supported platforms. Increase of complexity should be avoided.
- All contributions may be reused by [@brodybits (Chris Brody)](https://github.com/brodybits) under another license in the future. Efforts will be taken to give credit for major contributions but it will not be guaranteed.
- Project restructuring, i.e. moving files and/or directories around, should be avoided if possible.
- If you see a need for restructuring, it is better to first discuss it in new issue where alternatives can be discussed before reaching a conclusion. If you want to propose a change to the project structure:
  - Remember to make (and use) a special branch within your fork from which you can send the proposed restructuring;
  - Always use `git mv` to move files & directories;
  - Never mix a move/rename operation with any other changes in the same commit.
